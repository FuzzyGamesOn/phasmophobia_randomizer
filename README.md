# Item Randomizer for Phasmophobia

[![Screenshot of the Phasmophobia item randomizer tool](img/readme/example-screenshot.png)](https://fuzzygameson.github.io/phasmophobia_randomizer/index.html)

With the Item Randomizer for Phasmophobia, you can randomize evidence items, non-evidence items, light sources, and even what maps to play! 4 different difficulty settings allow you to tailor the randomizing experience to your skill level, and you can optionally disable certain settings that you don't want to randomize.

If you use this, please feel free to reach out and let me know what you think! I'm on Twitter at: https://twitter.com/fuzzygameson 

## How to use

To use, you can visit the Github hosted page of this at:

That's it! Just click the "Randomize" button and enjoy. :D 

If you want to customize your experience, use the "Settings" button to set specific options.
